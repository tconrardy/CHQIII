      <p><div class="popup" onclick="myFunction()">This photo-essay was sparked by a photo of a discarded shopping magazine.<span style="color:blue;">*</span><span class="popuptext" id="myPopup">*This photo is third-to-last in the photo-essay</span></div></p>
      <p>The magazine had caught my eye as a telltale sign of the retail mania that ensues every year in
        the leadup to the holidays. I had already been thinking about the ways that the pandemic was
        shaping Black Friday, but this was the first time that I had stopped to think about how the
        pandemic was changing our waste.</p>
      <p>I began scouting out trash to photograph, and thinking about how that waste was
        related to the pandemic. Some instances were obvious: a discarded mask, a dumpster full of
        chairs from a recently abandoned office building, a trashcan full of plastic bags in a usually
        tote-bag-toting neighborhood. Yet as I walked laps of my neighborhood on trash day, I found
        myself asking fewer questions about masks, disinfectants, and gloves, and more questions
        about seemingly mundane waste. Now that I was looking for garbage, it seemed impossible
        to ignore its sheer mass and omnipresence.</p>
      <p>It wasn’t that there had never been litter in parking lots or trash discarded in shrubs
        before; I had simply been conditioned to ignore that waste. If we “go through our everyday
        lives with a highly developed practice of not-seeing,” then ignoring trash is the pinnacle of
        this practice.<a href="#footnote9"><sup>9</sup></a> This sudden exposure to the garbage was also likely attributable to mass closures
        or partial closures of recycling and waste management facilities nationwide.<a href="#footnote10"><sup>10</sup></a>
        My personal “not-seeing” practices and the infrustructures that promote such habits were crumbling
        simultaneously.</p>
        <p>In searching for quotes, I encountered a similar trend. From my early observations
          about pandemic trash stemmed a hunch that PPE and packing waste would have skyrocketed
          since last year. Such waste has indeed increased significantly; between mask-wearing and
          increased individual packing, plastic usage has increased between 250% to 350% in 2020.<a href="#footnote11"><sup>11</sup></a>
          In searching for quotes about trash more generally, however, I encountered research showing
          that the crisis of American waste is one that predates 2020, and worse, will postdate it as well.</p>
          <p>
            The pandemic has not changed our waste trajectory; only accelerated it. In 2018, the
            World Bank predicted that global waste would increase by 70% by 2050.<a href="#footnote12"><sup>12</sup></a>
            My further research also strengthened my commitment to the topic of waste, as I learned that waste dumpsites
            are the third-largest source of human-generated methane, and that the nation’s waste facilities and incinerators
            have historically been found in low-income communities of color; that is, when our waste is not outsourced to other countries.<sup><a href="#footnote13">13</a>,<a href="#footnote14">14</a>,<a href="#footnote15">15</a></sup>
              To contemplate issues of waste is
            to contemplate issues of climate change, racism, and imperialism.</p>
          <p>I wanted to not only draw attention to the waste that we ignore, but to argue that the
            issue of American waste, like so many other issues that have come to a point in 2020, will not
            disappear with the pandemic. The pandemic has brought how we produce and handle waste
            to the forefront of the public consciousness, but “returning to normal” cannot mean re-turning a blind eye.</p>
          <p>In crafting this argument, I decided that the introduction to my photo-essay should
            start on the same note that I began my research: within the specific scope of the pandemic.
            The first photo—a mask on wet asphalt—plays into exactly what one might expect from
            a photo-essay about pandemic waste. The quote that follows—a quotation of one of my
            co-workers, in reference to that mask—conveys the same attitude that I had going into this
            project: that recent excess of waste in our community now is unique to this moment, and that
            it will dissipate once that moment is over.</p>
          <p>The subsequent photos and quotes reinforce that notion: that increasingly visible
            plastic bag waste is due to temporary bans on plastic bags, that discarded office furniture is a
            product of recent changes to corporate infrastructure, and that castaway vodka bottles can
            be attributed to recent spikes in alcohol consumption.</p>
          <p>For this first, more pandemic-focused section of the photo-essay, I also chose to take
            fairly short-range photos, as these close crops force the reader to look at trash up close and
            personal in a way that emphasizes how unaccustomed we are to really looking at trash. Starting
            with a short-range approach was also narratively compelling, given the transition from a
            narrow, pandemic-specific lens in the introduction to a broader look at how this moment fits
            into trends of American waste. As the quotes transition from anecdotal mentions of pandemic
            trash to broader observations about American waste, so too do the photos adjust their scope,
            going from tight shots like that of the plastic bags to a middle-distance shot of the shopping
            magazine to further widened shots like the trashcans on the street.</p>
          <p>I also chose to employ a black-and-white filter with color cutouts to help emphasize
            the trash in some of these later images. I wanted to emphasize the waste within scenes where
            we would normally ignore it, but I also wanted to test the reader’s eye. The last image is
            seemingly the least focused on the subject of trash, and has no such color cutouts. One might
            notice the hats, the Christmas decoration, or the garbage can before thinking to look for actual
            trash in the photo. The quote preceding this photo makes this fumble especially fitting; the
            last line reads, “One of the few relics of our civilization guaranteed to be recognizable twenty
            thousand years from now is the potato chip bag.” The very piece of trash that the reader
            might struggle to place is a Lays potato chip bag.</p>
          <p>This final image also serves as an apt conclusion because it is such an ordinary household scene.
            How is my household contributing to this issue? How is my community contributing to this issue?
            How am I contributing to this issue? The subsequent quote prevents a potential misreading of that
            scene; I am not suggesting that individual waste is the core issue, but rather that we must be aware
            of whether we are advocating for positive change within the systems that we contribute to.</p>
